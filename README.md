# MoveToFolder
A simple C# utility that moves files to a folder of the same name, minus the extension.

When running, you can specify the path to a file or directory as the only argument. 

If you specify a file, it will move that file to a directory of the same name, minus the extension.

If you specify a directory, it wil move all files in the directory specified to their own folders.

If nothing is specified, the current directory is assumed.
